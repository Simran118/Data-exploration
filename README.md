# Data-exploration

These are some of the Projects I work on my days off trying to better understand Tidyverse. I mostly use google sheets to clean and filter data and R to analyze and summarise the rest.
Along with that I'm still stuck at Boolean operations in learning Python but hopefully will be able to share my first project in Python.
